        function to cookies, and are used to track online usage metrics. In contrast to

        technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
        finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
        other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
        online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
        future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this
        Privacy Policy.
